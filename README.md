I Created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.

First I build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

  -Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
  -Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  -Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
  -Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Second I used Jupyter gmaps and the Google Places API to create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city
